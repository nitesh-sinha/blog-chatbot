I'm here to help you with your questions related to TechNibbana blog.\\n\\n   You asked about the difference between Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) and Content Security Policy (CSP).\\n\\n   Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a mechanism that allows a web page from one domain to request resources from another domain. It helps prevent unauthorized access to resources by allowing browsers to make requests to servers outside the domain from which the web page was loaded, under certain conditions.\\n\\n   On the other hand, Content Security Policy (CSP) is a security feature for websites that helps prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks and other code injection attacks. It does this by specifying a set of rules in an HTTP response header that defines what types of content are allowed to be loaded on the website, such as scripts, stylesheets, images, etc.\\n\\n   In summary, while CORS is about allowing cross-origin requests, CSP is about restricting the types of content that can be loaded from other origins in order to prevent potential security threats.\\n\\n   For more detailed information and examples, you may want to check out these resources:\\n\\n   - [MDN Web Docs: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS)\\n   - [OWASP: Content Security Policy (CSP)](https://owasp.org/www-community/images/7/72/Content_Security_Policy_Quick_Reference_Cheatsheet.pdf)\", \"additional_kwargs\": {}, \"response_metadata\": {}, \"type\": \"ai\", \"name\": null, \"id\": null, \"example\": false, \"tool_calls\": [], \"invalid_tool_calls\": [], \"usage_metadata\": null}}"
